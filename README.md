## ðŸ’» _Project_

This project was developed to solve the challenge of creating a car rental system for a Brazilian rental company, considering different tariffs and taxation rules. The system reads the rental data, calculates the amount to be paid and generates a detailed payment note.

## :computer: _technologies_

The following technologies were used in the development of this application:

- [Java]([https://nodejs.org/](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html))
- [API de tempo java]([https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html))

## :rocket: Features

- Flexible Pricing: Charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to 12 hours. If the rental length exceeds 12 hours, you will be charged on a daily basis.

- Tax Calculation: Applies the tax rate according to Brazilian rules:

  - 20% for amounts up to 100.00

  - 15% for amounts above 100.00

- Data Entry: Allows the entry of rental information, including car model, starting and ending times of the rental, hourly rate and daily rate.

- Payment Note Generation: Calculates the total rental value, the tax applied and generates a payment note, displaying the details on the screen.

### _How It Works_
1. Data Entry: The user provides the car model, the rental start and end date and time, as well as the hourly and daily values.

2. Cost Calculation: The system calculates the cost of the rental based on the duration (in hours or days) and the rates provided.

3. Tax Application: The system applies the tax according to the calculated value range.

4. Note Generation: The system generates and displays the payment note with the rental value, the tax amount and the total amount to be paid.

### _Follow the steps below:_
